==== Introduction ====

JSON.simple uses [http://code.google.com/p/json-test-suite/ json-test-suite] to do compliance testing.


==== Steps ====
 * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/json-test-suite/downloads/list latest json-test-suite package] from the home page of json-test-suite
 * Unzip and run the following command in the directory of the package:
   {{{
   ant -f test.xml compliance
   }}}
 * You may need to wait for a few minutes and then check the results from the following files:
   {{{
   TEST-org.json.simple.compliance.EncoderTest.txt
   TEST-org.json.simple.compliance.DecoderTest.txt
   }}}
